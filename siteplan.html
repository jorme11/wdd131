    <section>
        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p><strong>Star Quilting</strong></p>
        <p>This name reflects the creative and artistic focus of the business, which specializes in custom quilt designs
            — especially patterns featuring stars, a popular motif in quilting. The name is simple, memorable, and
            aligns well with the site's target audience: quilters and customers looking for professional quilting
            services and inspiration.</p>
        <p><em>Optional domain availability:</em> starquilting.com (availability not required for this class)</p>

            longarm quilting services, and a gallery of quilting examples. It serves both new and experienced quilters,
            and anyone looking for quilting services or ideas. Visitors will be able to browse the gallery, read FAQ
            answers, and send an email to ask questions regarding commission work.</p>
